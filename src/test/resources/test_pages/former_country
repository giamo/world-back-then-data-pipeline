Within a few decades of the official beginning of the nation-building project, Tokyo had become the political and economic capital of a state that replaced semi-autonomous domains with newly created prefectures subordinate to central laws and centrally appointed administrators.&quot;''{{sfn|Tsutsui|2009|p=433}}}} and [[great power]] that existed from the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868 to the enactment of the [[Constitution of Japan|1947 constitution]] of modern [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ndlconstitution&quot;/&gt;
Japan's rapid [[industrialization]] and [[militarization]] led to its emergence as a [[world power]].

==Terminology==
The historical state is frequently referred to as the &quot;Empire of Japan&quot;, the &quot;Japanese Empire&quot;, or &quot;Imperial Japan&quot; in English.
